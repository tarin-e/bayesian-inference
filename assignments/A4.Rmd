### Assignment 4
#### Tarin Eccleston

In this question, perform model averaging/selection to try to infer whether I used runif() or rexp().
Let U be the proposition that it was runif() and E be the proposition that it was rexp(). If U is
true, then the prior and sampling distribution are

log b ∼ Normal (0, 1)
xi | b ∼ Uniform(0, b)

If E is true, then the prior and sampling distribution are

log λ ∼ Normal (0, 1) (3)
xi | λ ∼ Exponential(λ)
